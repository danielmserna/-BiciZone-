This project (not the final version), I did in the second semester of 2019 with two colleagues. It is an application to consult the power data of a remotely located solar panel. At the site where the panel is located, there is an internet connection, from where the power values supplied by the panel are entered into a database. This Android application uses MySQL to access the photovoltaic cell database. Unlike other applications that use SQLite, this application uses PHP files to access the database. It also uses Google maps API to show the location of the PV cell and the user.
